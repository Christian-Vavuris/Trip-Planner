# Description

Trip Planner is an application that helps you plan the perfect trip. Simply search a city and you will find information about the weather aswell as local attractions like resturants and parks so you can get the full view of your day off!
>
This application was built with Skeleton Framework, the APIs used were Open Weather Map and Yelp Fusion to get the weather and local buisnesses respectfully. Our goal as a group was to make something that is easy to use and gives you the most relevant information regarding your upcoming trips. In addition to getting you the info you need our site stores the data locally so that you can leave the page without worring about losing your planned trips. 

# Objective

Create a web application that allows the user to search a city for information regarding local buisnesses and the weather. The Web app should look nice, be easy to use, as well as scale with any screen size. The application should run without any errors.

# User Guide

A guide on getting started quickly.

## Getting Started 

Starting from the landing page simpily click the *Get Started* button to be taken to the search page. If you'd like to quickly just check a city's weather you can scroll down to find the Weather Dashboard where you can search the city you plan to take your trip on. If you don't feel like typing and want to check the weather in your city, look outside. If you don't have windows click the *Get Location* button and *Allow* to generate local weather information.

## Search Page

From the Search Page you can enter a city, you can also use the drop down menus to specify what you want to search by and what Yelp categories you want to look for (by default the search looks for restaurants with the highest rating). When you find a Yelp Listing that you'd like to include on your trip simpily click on it to open up the modal. In the modal you can create a new trip if its your first time we recommend you first enter the name of your trip, click *Create* and then select your trip from the drop down menu at the top of the modal. You can then add a date for when you plan to go. You can then fill out a description to help you remember for later and press *Save* to save your trip. Once you're finished you can go to the *My Trips* page from the navbar.

## My Trips

In the My Trips page you can see all your old trips saved. If you want to see a trip click on the name of the trip you want to see you'll be presented with the name of the place you're going to with the date and description below it. To check the weather for your trip click on the city name to see the forecast. Now you can plan your trip with the weather in mind!
