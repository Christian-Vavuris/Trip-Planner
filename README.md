# [Trip Planner](christian-vavuris.github.io/trip-planner/)

Trip Planner is an application that helps you plan the perfect trip. Simply search a city and you will find information about the weather aswell as local attractions like resturants and parks so you can get the full view of your day off!
>
This application was built with Skeleton Framework, the APIs used were Open Weather Map and Yelp Fusion to get the weather and local buisnesses respectfully. Our goal as a group was to make something that is easy to use and gives you the most relevant information regarding your upcoming trips. In addition to getting you the info you need our site stores the data locally so that you can leave the page without worring about losing your planned trips.
